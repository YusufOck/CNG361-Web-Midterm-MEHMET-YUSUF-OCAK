# CNG-361 Midterm Project: Tech Solutions Inc. Team Page

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the solution for the **CNG-361 Web Programming Midterm Lab Practical**. The objective was to take a broken, non-semantic HTML file ("Starter Code") and transform it into a fully responsive, professional, and visually appealing team page using **Bootstrap 5**.

The project follows a "Fix and Build" approach, ensuring semantic HTML structure, proper Git version control, and modern UI/UX practices.

## 🚀 Key Features
Based on the grading rubric, the following features were implemented:

### 1. Foundation & Structure (Fix)
* **Semantic HTML5:** Replaced generic `div` tags with semantic tags like `<nav>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>`.
* **Meta Tags:** Added `<meta name="viewport">` to ensure proper rendering on mobile devices.
* **Language Attribute:** Set `<html lang="en">` for accessibility and SEO standards.

### 2. Bootstrap 5 Integration (Build)
* **Responsive Grid System:** Used `row`, `col-12` (mobile), and `col-md-6` (desktop) to create a responsive layout.
* **Components:** Implemented **Navbar**, **Cards**, and **Buttons** using standard Bootstrap classes.
* **Icons:** Integrated **Bootstrap Icons** for social media links and UI elements.

### 3. Visual Design & Polish (Customize)
* **Custom CSS:** Applied `linear-gradient` backgrounds and CSS variables for a "Tech Company" theme.
* **Interactivity:** Added CSS hover effects (`transform: translateY`) to team cards for a dynamic feel.
* **Typography:** Enhanced readability using Bootstrap utility classes (`fw-bold`, `text-muted`, `lead`).

### 4. Real World Data & Security
* **Real Content:** Integrated real team member data (CEO & CTO) with professional profile images.
* **Security Best Practices:** All external links (LinkedIn) use `target="_blank"` combined with `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to prevent security vulnerabilities (Tabnabbing).
